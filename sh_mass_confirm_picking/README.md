About
============
When you have bulk sale orders then it's very difficult to validate every picking one by one. This module provides functionality to validate all sale orders in a single click. The user has to select the sale orders from the list view and then validate all pickings. It shows notification in success & any issue in the validation. It shows a warning if not conformed sale orders.
